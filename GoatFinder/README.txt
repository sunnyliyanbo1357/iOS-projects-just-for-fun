Yanbo Li (yl2556)

What I did in GoatFinder:
1 Added the Tab View Controller, and changed the name and image for list and map items
2 Added the textChanged function, in response to the NSNotification in viewDidLoad, meaning it will active when the textfield is changed.
(1) Validate the name and age textfield is not empty. If not, the save button is disabled.
(2) Validate the age is integer. If not, the save button is disabled.
(3) If passed those two condition, the save button is inabled.
